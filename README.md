# EJS Digital Ocean Turorial by Smit Kakadiya
- A simple web application that I did to teach me how to implement wed based technologies.
- In this repository, I learned EJS (Embeded JavaScript Templating) and implemented with my Node Application.
- I have gone through Digital Ocean website in order to implement this javascript.
- Five major steps need to follow for running EJS into node application.
